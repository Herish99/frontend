    <h1>Async & await</h1>

    <h3>
        Certainly! async and await are modern features in JavaScript that make working with asynchronous code more
        readable and organized, especially when dealing with Promises. These keywords provide a more synchronous-like
        style to handle asynchronous operations. Let's break it down with a simple example:
    </h3>

    <h4>
        Imagine you're at a food truck, and you want to order a sandwich. Instead of standing in line and waiting for
        your turn, you take a numbered ticket and wait until your number is called. When your number is called, you can
        go directly to the counter to get your sandwich.
    </h4>



    <h3>
        In this analogy:
    </h3>

    <h4>
        <li>
            Taking a Numbered Ticket (Async): You initiate the order (asynchronous operation) and are given a numbered
            ticket (Promise) that represents the future result.
        </li>
        <li>
            Waiting for Your Number (Await): You use the await keyword to wait for your number (Promise) to be called.
            This allows you to pause your actions without blocking other people's orders.
        </li>
        <li>
            Getting Your Sandwich (Result): When your number is called and your sandwich is ready (Promise is
            fulfilled), you directly go to the counter to get your sandwich (get the resolved value).

        </li>
    </h4>




    <script>
        // Simulating an asynchronous operation with a Promise
        function makeSandwich(type) {
            return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                setTimeout(() => {
                    const sandwich = `${type} sandwich`;
                    resolve(sandwich);
                }, 2000); // Simulating a 2-second sandwich-making time
            });
        }

        // Using the async/await pattern
        async function orderSandwich() {
            try {
                console.log('Order placed. Taking a numbered ticket...');
                const sandwich = await makeSandwich('Buttered');
                console.log(`Received: ${sandwich}. Enjoy your meal!`);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error('Error:', error);
            }
        }

        // Placing an order (initiating the asynchronous operation)
        orderSandwich();

        console.log('Waiting for sandwich...');
