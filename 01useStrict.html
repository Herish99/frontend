    <h3>Use strict</h3>
    <p>variable means ======= vari (variety of values) + able( ability to hold/store ) ====== ability to store/hold variety of values </p>

    <p>The modern mode, "use strict"</p>
    <p>The directive looks like a string: "use strict" or 'use strict'. When it is located at the top of a script, the whole script works the “modern” way.</p>


<script>
    "use strict"                
    
    //using use strict will not allow assigning a value without using variables.
    //

     username = "herish"        //this will not work in strict
    let username = "herish"
    console.log(username);

    console.log(uname);         // this will not work in strict mode and even without strict mode in let and const.
    let uname = "parmar"
    

     // a_username = "Test" //Uncaught ReferenceError: username is not defined
     let a_username = "Test" //Uncaught ReferenceError: username is not defined
    console.log(a_username);
</script>
