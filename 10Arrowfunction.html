        //Arrow function is shorter version of function.
        //Arrow function is also called anonymous as it has no name in its syntax. It is saved in variable , and it is the main advantage of it due to its lexical environment and memory allocation.
        
        //As it is stored in variable it will occupy memory only when it is called [Lexical Env].   !important.
        // As we know variable inside function is called local scope, so to access a variable of global scope "this" property is used.
