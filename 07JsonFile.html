    <h1>Json file</h1>
    <p>Json file is nothing but a data storage formate that store a file occupying very less memory storage. For
        example, temporary data can be user-generated data, such as a submitted form on a website. JSON can also be used
        as a data format for any programming language to provide a high level of interoperability.
    </p>
    <h2>InShort JSON stands for JavaScript object Notation. JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting
        data

        JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page 
    </h2>
    <p>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>parse(): Accepts a JSON string as a parameter, and returns the corresponding JavaScript object.</li>
        <li>stringify(): Accepts an object as a parameter, and returns the equivalent JSON string.</li>
    </ol>

    //Thses are two properties to be used in json file formate.

    //whenever we are getting a json file , it will be in string formate because string cannot be break or [it is unbreakable] wile if they are in array or object formate there are possibility that they can break while transfering / sharing. 


    let fruits = {"mango" : 5 , "orange" : 4 , "banana" : "12" , "watermelon " : 1}
    // fruits.mango = 10           // using key , value has been changed.
    console.log(fruits);

    // JSON.stringyfy()  //  conversion of data-type[object] to string
    // JSON.parse()      //  conversion of string to data-type[object]
